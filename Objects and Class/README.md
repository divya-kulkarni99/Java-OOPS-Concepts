Declare 10 classes based on objects around you 

1. Include 2 nested classes for one of class
2. Each class must have at least 8 properties & 3 methods (no logic inside methods is fine, i.e., empty methods or just a print statement)
3. Print a statement in constructor to indicate creation of each instance, preferably identify each instance with unique id/name

Create a Main method to instantiate at least 3 objects of each class
